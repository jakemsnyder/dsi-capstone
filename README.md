# Exploring Candidate-Specific Polling Questions to Improve Polling Accuracy on US Elections
Authors: Kathy Lin, Jie Lu, Tin Oreskovic, Jake Snyder


## Abstract
Polling is one of the most robust methods to capture and understand public opinion,
especially in politics. However, as with all sampling methods, there are limitations and
biases, particularly with regard to the questions asked. We investigate a new question
format for political opinion polls with the goal of improving the effectiveness and predictive
power of these polls. Using a mobile polling strategy, we ask respondents demographic
information, as well as who they plan to vote for in the 2018 midterm elections. Our
research uses multilevel regression and poststratification to control for the well-known
biases within polling data, such as sampling bias and nonresponse bias. We use Bayesian
methods to predict two-party share of the 2018 midterm Congressional vote. Our research
shows that, with respect to predictive power, the new question format does not differ much
from the traditional format. Since the new question format requires more time and money
than the traditional format to implement, it does not seem worth the investment.
